# Steam Game Showcase Website
Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort to create a dynamic website showcasing the best games available on the Steam platform. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive resource for gamers to explore top-rated games, delve into detailed game analyses, and test their gaming knowledge.

My Contributions
As a member of the web development team, I focused on three main areas to enhance the website's functionality and user engagement:

Team Details Page: Developed a dedicated page to display detailed information about our project team, including names and ages. This page was designed to add a personal touch, allowing users to learn more about the minds behind the project. The implementation involved meticulous CSS styling to ensure a visually appealing layout that aligns with the overall aesthetic of the website.

Additional Content Page: Each team member was tasked with creating a unique content page to contribute additional value to our audience. My page included in-depth analyses, interesting facts, and hidden gems within the Steam gaming community. This segment required extensive research and creativity to produce content that was both informative and engaging.

Quiz Webpage: To foster interactive learning and assess the users' knowledge based on the information provided in the additional content page, I developed a quiz feature. This involved designing a series of questions that challenged users to recall and apply what they had learned. The implementation included HTML for the quiz structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to ensure a dynamic and responsive quiz experience.
