# Steam Game Showcase Website
# Project Overview
This project is a collaborative effort to create a dynamic website showcasing the best games available on the Steam platform. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive resource for gamers to explore top-rated games, delve into detailed game analyses, and test their gaming knowledge.

# My Contributions
As a member of the web development team, I focused on enhancing the website's functionality and user engagement through several key features:

# Team Details Page 
Developed a dedicated page to display detailed information about our project team, including names and ages. This page adds a personal touch, allowing users to learn more about the contributors behind the project. The implementation involved meticulous CSS styling to ensure a visually appealing layout that aligns with the overall aesthetic of the website.

# Additional Content Page 
Created a custom content page, providing in-depth analyses, interesting facts, and hidden gems within the Steam gaming community. This segment required extensive research and creativity to produce content that was both informative and engaging for our audience.

# Quiz Webpage
Designed a quiz feature to foster interactive learning and assess the users' knowledge based on the information provided in the additional content page. This involved HTML for the quiz structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for a dynamic and responsive quiz experience.

# Page Editor (Site Map) 
To provide a clear overview of the webpages I worked on, I developed a Page Editor that functions as a site map. This tool showcases the structure of our project and highlights my contributions, enhancing transparency and navigation for both team members and users. The Page Editor was carefully designed with a user-friendly interface, allowing easy access to the various sections of the website I was responsible for.
